<center><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I'm stayin' with you, if I'm choosing wrong<br>
I don't care at all<br>
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late<br>
That's all I want<br>
I don't care at all<br>
I am lost<br>
I don't care at all<br>
I am lost<br>
Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you<br>
And I wanna change<br>
Growing up alone, it seems so short<br>
I can't explain<br>
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny<br>
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel<br>
I don't care at all<br>
I am lost<br>
I don't care at all<br>
Lost my time, my life, it's going on<br>
I will be so strong, looking for a new version of myself<br>
'Cause now all I want is to be a part of my new world<br>
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny<br>
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel<br>
I don't care at all<br>
I am lost<br>
I don't care at all<br>
I am lost<br>
Why not have it all?<br>
I am lost<br>
Lost my time, my life it's going on<br></span></p></center>
